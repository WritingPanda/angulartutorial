<!-- Notes

	Factories and Services:
		* Used to make RESTful calls
		* Used to share data between controllers
		* Used to handle custom logic
		* Are Singletons
	Controllers:
		* Controllers act as the brain for a view
		* Retrieve data from a factory/service and store it
		* Handle events triggered by view
		* Know how to handle custom logic
		* Rely on the $scope object to interact with the view
	Views:
		* Contain HTML and CSS
		* Bind to data provided by a controller via the $scope object
		* Use directives to enhance HTML and render data
	Routes:
		* Reference a controller and view
		* Can include route parameters
