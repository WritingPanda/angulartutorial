## An AngularJS Tutorial

This code is built from my learning from [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/angularjs-jumpstart/#/) on Udemy.com.

Many thanks to [Dan Wahlin](https://twitter.com/DanWahlin) for making such a great course.

### Sections

1. AngularJS - The Big Picture
1. Views, Directives, and Filters
1. Controllers, Scope, and Modules
1. Routing
1. Factories and Services
1. UI and Animation

### Goals

* Get a solid understand of AngularJS
* Be able to teach others AngularJS for the JDev meetup
* Be able to work with AngularJS at my work
* Learn more about design patterns
* Understand the framework and when it would be best to use
* Develop a new personal website

If I come into any problems or issues with the course, I will be sure to label them in the next section.

### Issues with Course

* He uses an older version of Express, which causes problems as soon as he gets to that section
* In the later lectures, he goes so quickly that it is difficult to follow.
* There is something breaking in my code that I have a hard time figuring out. I think he might have glanced over something that I missed. I am not sure.

I completed it! Check it out!
